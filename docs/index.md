# AI Infographics
Welcome to our website.

This github repo is just a placeholder until we get
our MicroSim generators up to a higher quality.  I created
it after I had a person in the  textbook publishing space ask for a specific book
on how to generate high-quality infographcs with hover and drill-down features.
Since we started this our energy has been put into generalizing infographics
to include interactive MicroSims that work with the xAPI protocols.

Infographics are now considered a subset of the overall [MicroSim Architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19864).  We would love your feedback on if this book is still needed.

Until we decide we need a separate book , please visit the following sites:

[MicroSims Site](https://dmccreary.github.io/microsims/)

[MicroSim Search and Similarity](https://dmccreary.github.io/search-microsims/)
Faceted Search over 800 MicroSims.

[Claude Skill](https://dmccreary.github.io/claude-skills/) - note that
the skill in this book now work with OpenAI's codex command line interface.

[Claude Skills MicroSims](https://dmccreary.github.io/claude-skills/sims/)
Working AI Skill files that are precise rules and complex decision trees used to generate textbooks with precise rules for
mapping a learning objective to a MicroSim type.

[Intelligent Textbook Case Studies](https://dmccreary.github.io/intelligent-textbooks/case-studies/)

[Automating Instructional Design](https://dmccreary.github.io/automating-instructional-design/) full of wonderful material about how to map a learning objective to a MicroSim type.

[Statistics Course](https://dmccreary.github.io/statistics-course/) - many microsims that discuss how data types determine visualizations.
