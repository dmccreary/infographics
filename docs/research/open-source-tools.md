# Open Source Tools

!!! prompt
    Please assist me by conducting research on the availability of tools for creating consistent, interactive infographics that teachers can use within intelligent textbooks.

    Our goal is to develop a streamlined approach to creating detailed, interactive infographics for textbooks that do not require advanced programming skills.  We hope to utilize generative AI to make creating infographics more accessible for all teachers. Our infographics need to have clickable or hover regions that we can monitor to gauge whether students are using and learning from them.  The current best practice is to use tools like D3.js and p5.js to create infographics.  However, these JavaScript libraries are too complex for many teachers with no programming background. 

    We also need these infographics to follow simple rules to make them consistent with the other infographics on the websites.  They should  all have a consistent background color and logging of what the students are clicking on

    Please analyze the free tools that can make the process of creating consistent interactive infographics easier for teachers.  Return a report of these tools and how they can be used to make low-code/no-code infographics.  We are interested in mostly free and open-source tools.

## Initial Response

To ensure I provide the most useful recommendations, could you please clarify the following:

Do you need the tools to support embedding in existing platforms like Moodle, Google Classroom, or custom LMSs?

Is there a specific data format or structure the teachers will be using (e.g., spreadsheets, CSVs, JSON)?

Should the tools support exporting the infographics as standalone HTML/JS files or integrate directly with an AI workflow?

Are there any specific accessibility or device compatibility requirements (e.g., mobile-friendly, screen reader support)?

This will help me tailor the research to fit your goals more closely.

Thanks for the clarification. I’ll research free and open-source tools that enable teachers to create consistent, interactive infographics with low-code or no-code approaches. These tools will support hover and click interactions, event logging capabilities, and optionally export standalone HTML/JS for integration into intelligent textbooks. I’ll also look for tools that allow customization for visual consistency and offer hooks for tracking student interactions.

I’ll get back to you with a report summarizing the best tools, how they work, and how they can meet your specific goals.
