# Back of he Napkin

"The Back of the Napkin: Solving Problems and Selling Ideas with Pictures" is a book by Dan Roam. Its drawing framework gives you accurate details about the **six main types of drawings** that correspond to his "6 Ws" framework for visual problem-solving. Here are the primary drawing types featured in the book:

## The Six Visual Frameworks

**Portrait**
Used for answering "Who/What" questions. These simple drawings help identify and represent people, objects, or concepts using basic shapes, stick figures, and recognizable symbols.

**Chart** 
Used for answering "How Much" questions. Includes bar, line, area, or pie charts to represent quantitative data and comparisons.

**Map**
Used for answering "Where" questions. These drawings show spatial relationships, locations, and positions of elements relative to each other.

**Timeline**
Used for answering "When" questions. Shows sequences of events over time, which might be simple (showing just a few events) or elaborate (showing many events grouped by category into parallel timelines).

**Flowchart**
Used for answering "How" questions. These diagrams show processes, systems, and cause-and-effect relationships using connected shapes and arrows.

**Multiple-Variable Plot**
Used for answering "Why" questions. These more complex drawings show relationships between multiple factors and help explain underlying reasons or correlations.

## Key Drawing Principles

The book emphasizes that these drawings should be **simple and hand-drawn**, using basic shapes, lines, arrows, smiley faces, and stick figures - nothing that requires advanced artistic skills. Roam believes all other possible visual representations are derived from these six basic frameworks.

## SQVID Framework

Roam also introduces the SQVID framework to help determine which style of drawing to use, considering whether the visual should be:

- **S**imple vs. Elaborate
- **Q**ualitative vs. Quantitative  
- **V**ision vs. Execution
- **I**ndividual vs. Comparison
- **D**elta (change) vs. Status quo

These frameworks are integrated into what Roam calls a "Visual Thinking Codex" that guides readers through selecting the appropriate type of drawing based on the problem they're trying to solve or communicate.
