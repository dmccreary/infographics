# Slide Art Inforgraphics

Here is a detailed list of slide art types available in presentation tools such as Google Slides or MicroSoft PowerPoint**, organized by category.

These categories group diagrams by their purpose, and each type has multiple layouts. While the exact options may vary slightly by PowerPoint version, these are the core SmartArt graphic types included in most recent versions of Microsoft 365, PowerPoint 2016â€“2021, and Office 2021.

## Categories of SmartArt in PowerPoint

Each category contains layouts optimized for different purposes:

### List Diagram Types

List infographics are to present information that does not need to follow a specific order.  Items in these list can be rearranged without changing
the meaning of the infographic.

1. Basic Block List
1. Vertical Bullet List
1. Horizontal Bullet List
1. Picture Accent List
1. Vertical Picture List
1. Grouped List
1. Bending Picture Accent List
1. Circle Picture List
1. Continuous Picture List
1. Grid List
1. Horizontal Picture List
1. Vertical Box List
1. Vertical Chevron List
1. Vertical Block List
1. Staggered Process List

### Process Diagram Types

Process diagrams are used to show progression**, steps in a task**, or a timeline.  In these infographic types, order is key and a rearrangement
might change the mean or make the diagram incorrect.  These
basic diagrams do not have loops or feedback.

1. Basic Process
1. Accent Process
1. Process Arrows
1. Continuous Block Process
1. Chevron Process
1. Circular Bending Process
1. Picture Accent Process
1. Step Up Process
1. Upward Arrow Process
1. Downward Arrow Process
1. Vertical Process
1. Text Cycle
1. Gear Process
1. Timeline
1. Segmented Process

### Cycle

Used to show repeating processes*1. or circular flows that include feedback.
Many of these cycle types include relationships that are labeled.

1. Basic Cycle
1. Continuous Cycle
1. Cycle Matrix
1. Circle Arrow Process
1. Text Cycle
1. Block Cycle
1. Radial Cycle
1. Gear Cycle
1. Picture Accent Cycle
1. Segmented Cycle
1. Nested Cycle
1. Funnel Cycle

### Hierarchy Diagrams

Used to show **organizational structure*1. or **family trees**.

1. Organization Chart
1. Name and Title Organization Chart
1. Picture Organization Chart
1. Horizontal Organization Chart
1. Table Hierarchy
1. Labeled Hierarchy
1. Horizontal Labeled Hierarchy
1. Circle Picture Hierarchy

### Relationship Diagrams

Used to show **interconnections*1. or **how items relate to one another**.

1. Basic Venn
1. Radial Venn
1. Target Diagram
1. Basic Radial
1. Circular Radial
1. Counterbalance Arrows
1. Balanced Matrix
1. Segmented Pyramid
1. Converging Radial
1. Diverging Radial
1. Opposing Ideas
1. Interconnected Rings
1. Hexagon Cluster
1. Plus and Minus

### Grid or Matrix Diagrams

Used to show relationships of components to a whole based on two dimensions.

1. Basic Matrix
1. Grid Matrix
1. Titled Matrix
1. Labeled Matrix

### Pyramid Diagrams

Used to show proportional, hierarchical relationships.

1. Basic Pyramid
1. Inverted Pyramid
1. Pyramid List
1. Segmented Pyramid
1. Picture Pyramid
1. Funnel
1. Pyramid Accent List

### Picture Digrams

Used to incorporate images into lists, cycles, or relationships.

1. Picture Accent List
1. Picture Accent Process
1. Picture Accent Cycle
1. Vertical Picture List
1. Horizontal Picture List
1. Bending Picture Accent List
1. Circle Picture Hierarchy
1. Picture Caption List
1. Picture Grid
1. Picture Stack


### Additional Paramters to Diagrams

1. **Customized Layouts**: Shapes, colors, styles, and text formatting can all be adjusted within an infographic.
1. **Animations**: can be applied to individual components for presentations.  For example, circles can move along lines to
show direction of flow of data or causality.
