We hope to utilize generative AI to make creating infographics more accessible for all teachers. Our infographics need to have clickable or hover regions that we can monitor to gauge whether students are using and learning from them.  The current best practice is to use tools like D3.js and p5.js to create infographics.  However, these JavaScript libraries are too complex for many teachers with no programming background. </p> <p>We also need these infographics to follow simple rules to make them consistent with the other infographics on the websites.  They should  all have a consistent background color and logging of what the students are clicking on</p> <p>Please analyze the free tools that can make the process of creating consistent interactive infographics easier for teachers.  Return a report of these tools and how they can be used to make low-code/no-code infographics.
